Hello there!

My name is Matilda Olsson and I'm a system developer student from Skåne, Sweden 🇸🇪


**What are my specialties you may ask?**
- Basic programming and database management with C#, SQL and .NET
- Currently learing more web development in CSS, HTML, JS and React!

*A little fun fact*: I'm a big outdoors person who tries to sneak in frogs in projects if I can for examole in [this project](https://github.com/matilda002/FollowTheLight) 🐸
