Hello there!

My name is Matilda and I'm a system developer student from Sweden 🇸🇪


**What are my specialties you may ask?**
- Basic programming with C#, SQL and .NET
- Currently learing more web development in CSS, HTML, JS and React!

*A little fun fact*: I'm a big outdoors person who tries to sneak in frogs in projects if I can 🐸
