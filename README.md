Hi!

My name is Matilda Olsson and I'm a system developer student from Skåne, Sweden 🇸🇪

**Skills:**
- Basic programming and database management with C#, SQL and .NET.
- Basic web development in CSS, HTML, JS and React!
- Knowledge about working with agile methods in projects

*A little fun fact*: I'm a big outdoors person who tries to sneak in frogs in projects if I can for example in [this project](https://github.com/matilda002/FollowTheLight) 🐸
